# Materialize Gulp Starter Template

## IMPORTANT

I am not maintaining this repo in the slightest.  Many of the packages required could be outdated.  Please clone with a grain of salt.  Thanks!

## Installation

`npm install`


If you are on mac or linux and have installation issues make sure to use sudo command 


`sudo npm install`

## Usage

`gulp`


Go to localhost:8080 to see the site

Minified files will be placed in build folder

Keep in mind that nothing is included except the basic file structure and materialize.  

I have also included the fonts that come with the Materialize css framework.  To use them you must create an @fontface for them in your own css/scss files.

Add your own css/scss/js to appropriate files in root assets folder.
